## Problem Statement:
Determine whether a given number is even or odd.

## Approach:
1. **Input**: A number `n`.
2. **Output**: 
   - "Even" if the number is divisible by 2.
   - "Odd" if the number is not divisible by 2.

### Steps:
- []. Take a number as input.
- []. Check if the number is divisible by 2.
- []. Use the modulus operator (`%`) to check the remainder when the number is divided by 2.
- []. If the remainder is `0`, the number is even.
- []. Otherwise, the number is odd.
