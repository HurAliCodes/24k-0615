# Algorithm: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

## Problem Statement:
Determine whether a given number is even or odd.

## Approach:
1. **Input**: A number `n`.
2. **Output**: 
   - "Even" if the number is divisible by 2.
   - "Odd" if the number is not divisible by 2.

### Steps:
1. Take a number as input.
2. Check if the number is divisible by 2.
   - Use the modulus operator (`%`) to check the remainder when the number is divided by 2.
3. If the remainder is `0`, the number is even.
4. Otherwise, the number is odd.
5. Print the result.
